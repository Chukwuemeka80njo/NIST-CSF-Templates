# 🎯 2. Purpose & Scope
This plan identifies and tracks actions required to move from the **Current Profile** to the **Target Profile**, addressing gaps across:

- Governance  
- Controls implementation  
- Risk mitigation  
- Monitoring  
- Incident readiness  
- Recovery capability  

Scope includes all CSF Functions, categories, subcategories, and implementation priorities.

# 🧭 3. Strategic Objectives
List high-level security modernization or compliance objectives.

Examples:

- Strengthen identity and access controls  
- Improve detection and monitoring maturity  
- Implement formal risk governance  
- Enhance incident response capability  
- Expand recovery and resilience planning
