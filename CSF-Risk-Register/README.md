# CSF Risk Register – Cybersecurity Risk Tracking & Analysis

The **CSF-Risk-Register** folder contains templates and tools for documenting, analyzing, and managing cybersecurity risks in alignment with the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**. These documents support risk-informed decision-making and help maintain a consistent, auditable record of cybersecurity risks.

A risk register is a core component of any mature cybersecurity and GRC program.
