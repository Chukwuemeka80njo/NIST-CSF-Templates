# NIST CSF Risk Register Template  
This Risk Register supports the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) and helps track risks, scoring, likelihood, impact, residual risk, and treatment decisions.  
Use this register during assessments, gap analysis, and continuous improvement cycles.

|-------|---------|
| **Risk ID** | RR-### |
| **Risk Title** |  |
| **Risk Owner** |  |
| **Date Identified** |  |
| **CSF Function** | Identify / Protect / Detect / Respond / Recover |

## 📌 Risk Description

**Describe the risk scenario:**  
- Threat source & event  
- Vulnerability exploited  
- Potential business impact  

> Example: *Unauthorized access due to weak password policy may lead to data exposure.*

---

## 📌 Likelihood & Impact Scoring  
*(Customize scoring scale as needed: Low / Medium / High or 1–5)*

| Criteria | Rating | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **Likelihood** |  |  |
| **Impact** |  |  |
| **Inherent Risk Score** | (Likelihood × Impact) |  |

---

## 📌 Existing Controls

List the current controls in place:

- Technical controls  
- Administrative controls  
- Physical controls  
- Monitoring or logging  
- Policies/procedures  

---

## 📌 Control Effectiveness

| Control Type | Rating | Notes |
|--------------|--------|-------|
| **Preventive Controls** |  |  |
| **Detective Controls** |  |  |
| **Corrective Controls** |  |  |
| **Overall Control Strength** | Strong / Moderate / Weak |  |

## 📌 Residual Risk

| Field | Value |
|-------|--------|
| **Residual Likelihood** |  |
| **Residual Impact** |  |
| **Residual Risk Score** |  |

---

## 📌 Risk Treatment Decision  
Choose one:

- **Avoid** – eliminate the activity causing the risk  
- **Mitigate** – apply additional controls  
- **Transfer** – insurance or vendor responsibility  
- **Accept** – document justification and monitor  

| Field | Notes |
|-------|--------|
| **Selected Treatment Option** |  |
| **Planned Controls / Mitigation Steps** |  |
| **Responsible Person(s)** |  |

## 📌 Monitoring & Review

| Field | Value |
|-------|--------|
| **Review Frequency** | Monthly / Quarterly / Annually |
| **Next Review Date** |  |
| **Status** | Open / In Progress / Closed |

## 📌 Attachments / References  
- Evidence files  
- Policy references  
- Assessment reports  
- Diagrams / architecture

### ✔ Tips for Use
- Use one row per risk if converting to spreadsheet format.  
- Track changes over assessment cycles.  
- Link each risk back to a CSF Subcategory for strong audit relevance.
